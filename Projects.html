            <h3><span>Crystal Tester : </span></h3>
            <p> Testing the crystals one by one without an appropriate device would be a very slow and time taking process and 
                commercial crystal testers are very expensive, that is why simple electronic crystal is constructed.This tester 
                circuit will also form an oscillator circuit to test a crystal.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>Raspberry Pi Pico 200khz Digital Oscilloscope</span></h3>
            <p> The raspberry Pi Pico digital oscilloscope is made as a portable waveform analyzer and signal generator with a 
                dedicated application and runs on Android. It shows square waves or sine waves and detect the signals upto 250 
                khz frequency for each channel. Therefore, a mobile phone can be used as an oscilloscope with a raspberry 
                interface.</p>

            <h3><span>Virtual Reality Based Home Automation</span></h3>
            <p>Virtual Reality technology is used for designing and developing of virtual world using unreal engine. Interaction
                with real world ICT tools is possible with blynk application. In this project, the application Home automation 
                using virtual reality is developed and real-world applications like tube lights, fans etc., are controlled.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>Voice Assistant</span></h3>
            <p> The project aims to develop a personal-assistant. Jarvis draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like 
                Cortana for Windows, Siri for iOS and Alexa for Amazon. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly 
                interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands.</p>
